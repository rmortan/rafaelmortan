              <h2>Attributes</h2>
               <p>I believe that hard work is the key to success. To succeed in 
                  life one must endure the challenges life presents and work to overcome
                  hese challenges to be the best possible person that one can be.
                  We must not only use hard work to impress those around us but also 
                  to achieve goals that we set for ourselves. If we as individuals 
                  do not work hard to succeed, then we do not receive the same 
                  satisfaction as we would if we put in hour upon hour or even year upon
                  year of work to achieve our goals. I believe for one to be successful,
                  he must be willing to work hard to succeed in any aspect of life.</p>  
               <p>What is a hard worker?What qualifies a person to be categorized 
                  as a hard worker? He or She would have to be willing to do the work 
                  and not only do it but do it right. <em>Efficiency?</em> Efficiency 
                  is showing up on time and getting the job done right in a decent amount 
                  of time.A person would have the knowledge to be able to do their work.
                  Just as the cell is basic for life efficiency is the basic factor of 
                  all hard workers. Efficiency is extremely important it ties in 
                  with the other factors of the hard worker. Bosses look for people who 
                  are efficient people who get the job done the best and fastest way. 
                  Efficiency is not only better and faster but it is also cheaper another
                  factor of efficiency is tardiness. Tardiness is a big factor in the 
                  work place No matter whom a person works for they will not keep their
                  job if there is a problem getting to work on time. The one about your
                  car not starting only works so many times before they say You are 
                  Fired Bottom line is do not be late One morning if the car does not 
                  start the most important thing to do should be to call and tell your
                  employer what happened Fix it later Just find a ride to work for now. 
                  The second factor in a hard worker is the knowledge base of the person.
                  Knowledge base is the person right for the job A knowledge base 
                  should not only contain the skills needed to do the job but also some 
                  common sense meaning problem solving skills.               
               </p>                        
              <h2>Leadership</h2>
               <p>Due to its multi-faceted composition and complexity, leadership is a common word that is difficult to describe. In ctuality, leadership can be defined in a variety of way. It is an act of influencing an organized group in their activities for setting goals and reaching achievement. It can also be defined as influence exercised in a particular situation to achieve one or more goals. 
               </p>
               <p>A leader must possess a variety of qualities. The best leaders understand they don't know everything. Acting as though you know everything while being a leader is a misconception that is very dangerous when it comes to leadership. It is important to gather information from other individuals before making a final decision on an issue. A good leader should gather opinions and views from others in order to broaden their knowledge of a situation. This is important even when the final decision is left up to the person in charge of the group.<br>I AM THIS LEADER.

                            Used advance Q.C. equipment for inspections. i.e. 4600 series
                            14" vertical beam Measured and marked dimensions and reference
                            points accurately. Measured instruments to verify compliance 
                            with precise specifications. Dismantled and inspected components
                            and adjusted and repaired them as necessary. Trained, directed 
                            and instructed apprentices and helpers. Fabricated tools, jigs 
                            and fixtures to meet manufacturing and engineering needs. Measured, 
                            marked and indicated proper dimensions and reference points on 
                            materials and work pieces for future reference. Calculated and 
                            set controls to regulate machining factors like part speed, feed,
                            coolant flow, depth, angle of cut and clamping methods.
                            Machined small and large parts to tolerances of .00015 or less.
                            Made appropriate offset corrections for tool wear, broken tools
                            and casting variations.Selected appropriate speeds and feeds
                            according to type of metal and finish specifications.Executed bench,
