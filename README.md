#resume_project

I set out to just make ONE page brief history and this project became something else slowly but surely and going to become.
Truly loving the process and NOW that i know what i know    MY HATS OFF TO ALL GOOD WEB DEVELOPERs DESIGNERS truly a GOOD but HARD job when done right.

create SCSS mixin for responsive breakpoints and four media query breakpoint variables (large, medium, small, extra small). After creating those, we should create SCSS mixin with SASS map combining SCSS mixin for responsive breakpoints that we’ve written before. Now we continue with creating SASS map with key-value pairs – breakpoints as keys and font sizes as corresponding values. Putting it all together will take a little home and foot work but with the many resourses available including my main source @capitalJ i beliveit will be very possible.

I'de like to split those mixins nd variables into two different files so you can better manage and organize your SASS/SCSS project. I will also try using one base font size for the body, something like 14px – 18px. For all child elements use em or rem units. Later when you change the base font size of the body, all child elements will adapt and proportionally vary based on your primary font size, i think this will work for this project.
